# The Daily Dog House

## Project Description

My app is called The Daily Dog House.  It's a random image app for people who enjoy the occasional canid candid!  Users can view random doggos one at a time, or turn things up to 11 by viewing, 11 dogs at a time!  In the future I'd like to add some quality of life functionality like additional interface buttons.

### MVP User Stories

_**MVP User Stories**_
- _As a user, I want to be able to use the available interface to view random dogs, so that I can experience what the app offers in its most basic iteration._
- _As a user, I want to have the dogs' images display in a way that's simple and easy to read, so the app is more accessible, and intuitive._
- _As a user, I want the images that are displayed to be random, so that the experience is always fresh and exciting._

_**Post MVP Stretch Goals**_
- _As a user, I would like to have additional search features, so that I can better navigate the application's stockpile of dog images_
- _As a user, I would like to be able to save favorite images, so that I can easily see them again._
- _As a user, I would like to see some .gif animations, so that I can see the dogs doing what they do best in short, easily viewable clips._
